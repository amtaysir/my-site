<p>Nf is considered by most people the new eminem. This statement is very wrong but at the<br>
 same time slightly true. Nf like eminem is an extremely talented rapper toping the billboard<br>
 with his albums three consecutive time. He is also a very entertaining rapper who puts his emotions<br>
 and expierrences into his rhymes.<br> <img src="nf3.PNG" height="500" width="370"><a href="PICS.html">more pictures</a></p></div>    
<p align="center"> Nf is famously known for his outstanding  all-black outfits and a wide hoody. NF unlike most rappers<br>
claims he doesn't like the fame and prefers to be the underdog. Sadly for him his fan base grows daily<br>
with his songs being appreiated all over the world and fans craving his clothing brand.<br>
One of the famous songs that brought him out of the shadow is leave me alone. NF in this song displayed<br>
 amazing talent that shook the American music industry.<br>
